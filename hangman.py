    * At the start of the game, let the user know how many
    letters the secret_word contains and how many guesses s/he starts with.
    * The user should start with 6 guesses
    * Before each round, you should display to the user how many guesses
    s/he has left and the letters that the user has not yet guessed.
    * Ask the user to supply one guess per round. Remember to make
    sure that the user puts in a letter!
    * The user should receive feedback immediately after each guess
    about whether their guess appears in the computer's word.
    * After each guess, you should display to the user the
    partially guessed word so far.
    Follows the other limitations detailed in the problem write-up.
